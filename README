E-ANTIC -- (Real Embedded) Algebraic Number Theory In C
=======================================================

e-Antic is a C/C++ library to deal with real embedded number fields built on
top of ANTIC (https://github.com/wbhart/antic). It allows to consider number
fields as subfield of the real or complex numbers. Operations such as
comparison, floor, ceil, abs, ... are available.

The library is currently under active development.

The dependencies are:
 - flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).
 - arb (see http://arblib.org/)
 - antic (see https://github.com/wbhart/antic/)

To build E-ANTIC simply run

    $ cd E_ANTIC_ROOT
    $ ./bootstrap.sh   # only if building from git
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

For developers:

    $ make -j8 distcheck
