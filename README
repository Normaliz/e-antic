E-ANTIC -- (Embedded) Algebraic Number Theory In C
===================================================

E-Antic is a library to deal with embedded number fields built
on top of ANTIC (https://github.com/wbhart/antic). It allows to
consider number fields as subfield of the real or complex numbers.
Operations such as comparison, floor, ceil, abs, ... are available.

The library is currently under active development.

The dependencies are:
 - flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).
 - arb
 - antic
