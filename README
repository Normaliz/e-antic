E-ANTIC -- (Real Embedded) Algebraic Number Theory In C
=======================================================

e-Antic is a C/C++ library to deal with real embedded number fields built on
top of ANTIC (https://github.com/wbhart/antic). Its aim is to have as fast
as possible exact arithmetic operations and comparisons.

The library is currently under active development.

The dependencies are:

 - flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).
 - arb (see http://arblib.org/)
 - antic (see https://github.com/wbhart/antic/)

To build E-ANTIC simply run

    $ cd E_ANTIC_ROOT
    $ ./bootstrap.sh   # only if building from git
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

For developers:

    $ make distcheck
