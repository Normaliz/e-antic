RE-ANTIC -- (Real Embedded) Algebraic Number Theory In C
=========================================================

re-Antic is a library to deal with real embedded number fields built
on top of ANTIC (https://github.com/wbhart/antic). It allows to
consider number fields as subfield of the real or complex numbers.
Operations such as comparison, floor, ceil, abs, ... are available.

The library is currently under active development.

The dependencies are:
 - flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).
 - arb (see http://arblib.org/)
 - antic (see https://github.com/wbhart/antic/)

Installation

1) Compile flint with arb and antic as extensions

    $ cd FLINT_ROOT
    $ ./configure --extensions="ARB_ROOT ANTIC_ROOT"
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

2) Compile reantic

    $ cd REANTIC_ROOT
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Soon enough, it will be possible to build reantic as a flint extension as well.
